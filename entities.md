1. Authentication server: which connects to a local mysql database
    1.1 This database contains a list of shared passwords of all the clients(long term secure passwords)

2. The client (2 of them, one is authorised to use a file server, other is not)

3. TGS (Ticket Granting Service): Server which creates a ticket for the client after getting the pass key originally generated by the auth server.

4. The file server: This is the server our client is trying to access.
    

Steps:
1. Run all the servers
2. Run client, 
    TAKE INPUT in while True (EXIT FOR INPUT "exit")
    2.1 Check if a valid Kat(ltk) is present
        2.1.1 If it is present and valid, just use it
        2.1.2 Otherwise, create a new one and store in db

    2.2 Check if local variable Kab is set (i.e there is a valid Kab already present)
        2.2.1 If Kab is present and valid, use it to communicate with fileServer
        2.2.2 Otherwise, create a new one and store it locally (not in db as it is short-lived)

Everytime, Kab expires, the client will send a request to TGS and TGS first checks if Kat is valid. If Kat expires at this point, a new Kat is created and for the the client has to send a request to the authServer

TODO for oct 16: 
1. Change the structure of client, input should be read first in While True
2. TGS should also check if Kat is valid not just authServer
3. Use more functions everywhere

Everything is working well

TODO for oct 17:
1. When client enters exit, send exiting message to all servers as well so they don't break
2. client.py is in functions do that for all the servers as well
3. Make a kill_sockets() function for all entities and use it whenever they're closed
