1. Authentication server: which connects to a local mysql database
    1.1 This database contains a list of shared passwords of all the clients(long term secure passwords)

2. The client (2 of them, one is authorised to use a file server, other is not)

3. TGS (Ticket Granting Service): Server which creates a ticket for the client after getting the pass key originally generated by the auth server.

4. The file server: This is the server our client is trying to access.
    

Steps:
1. Run all the servers
2. Run client, 
    TAKE INPUT in while True (EXIT FOR INPUT "exit")
    2.1 Check if a valid Kat(ltk) is present
        2.1.1 If it is present and valid, just use it
        2.1.2 Otherwise, create a new one and store in db

    2.2 Check if local variable Kab is set (i.e there is a valid Kab already present)
        2.2.1 If Kab is present and valid, use it to communicate with fileServer
        2.2.2 Otherwise, create a new one and store it locally (not in db as it is short-lived)

Everytime, Kab expires, the client will send a request to TGS and TGS first checks if Kat is valid. If Kat expires at this point, a new Kat is created and for the the client has to send a request to the authServer
